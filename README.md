**A live visual surface for your terminal coding agent.**

shuvshow is a rebranded fork of [sideshow](https://github.com/modem-dev/sideshow), initially based on
upstream release `v0.13.0`. It preserves upstream's MIT license and compatibility contracts while using
an independent product, package, repository, and release identity. See the
[upstream delta and sync policy](docs/upstream-delta.md).

Your agent works in a wall of text; shuvshow gives it a screen. It publishes
**surfaces** — diagrams, UI sketches, rendered markdown, syntax-highlighted
diffs, terminal output, images — and they render live in your browser while it
works.

## Why

- **See what your agent means.** An architecture it's proposing, a flow it's
  tracing, a UI it's about to build — shown, not described in a paragraph you
  have to picture in your head.
- **Multimodal.** Combine diffs with mermaid diagrams, terminal output with HTML
  explainers, and more. Combine surfaces to illustrate ideas better.
- **Faster, and fewer tokens.** A standalone HTML document re-sends its whole
  design system every time; a surface sends only the content and the viewer
  supplies the chrome — far fewer tokens, and a faster draw. See
  [Token economics](#token-economics).
- **Works with the agent you already use.** Works with any agent harness: Claude Code
  (desktop or CLI), Codex (desktop or CLI), Opencode, Pi, etc.

## Quick start

Requires Node 22.18 or newer.

```sh
npm install
npx shuvshow serve --open   # viewer on http://localhost:8228
```

Then point your agent at the surface — paste the setup block into its
instructions:

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:8228/setup >> AGENTS.md
```

That bootstrap tells any agent with a shell (Pi, opencode, amp, codex, Claude
Code) to fetch the current instructions from the running server, then publish
surfaces and read your comments. Ask it to "sketch this on shuvshow" and watch
the card appear.

The running viewer has the same handoff built in: its sidebar footer carries an
**agent setup** link (the block above) and a polished **connect agent** screen, so
you can grab the right MCP command without leaving the browser.

No agent handy? `npx shuvshow demo` seeds two example sessions to look around.

**Going further:** richer integration tiers (CLI, MCP, the Pi extension, and the
Claude Code skill + plugin) are in **[docs/connecting-agents.md](docs/connecting-agents.md)**.

## What your agent can show

Every card below is real — published over the API and captured straight from the
viewer. A surface is an ordered list of **parts**; one card can carry several.

## Token economics

Showing something visually costs tokens — the ones your agent spends _writing_
it. A standalone HTML document pays for its whole design system (doctype, reset,
palette, typography, component CSS, often a little JS) on every render. A surface
pays for none of it: it hands the content over as data — mermaid source, a JSON
value, a markdown table, a diff patch — and the viewer supplies the theme. Fewer
output tokens also means a faster draw, since a model writes them one at a time.

Measured both ways on identical content (output tokens):

| Showing…              | Hand-built HTML     | shuvshow surface     | Saved |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------- | ----- |
| Architecture diagram  | hand-drawn SVG      | mermaid source       | ~90%  |
| API response          | tree markup + JS    | json surface         | ~88%  |
| Data table            | table + CSS         | markdown table       | ~83%  |
| Interactive UI mockup | standalone document | themed html fragment | ~42%  |

Even an HTML surface you author inherits the viewer's theme tokens and
pre-styled controls instead of shipping its own, so it still comes out ahead.

## Run it anywhere

shuvshow runs locally as a small Node server, or on Cloudflare Workers when your
agent and your browser live on different machines (or you want the viewer on your
phone). See **[docs/deploying.md](docs/deploying.md)**.

Each surface has an **open-as-image** action in its footer that renders the
surface to a PNG (`/p/:id.png`) — handy for pasting into a doc or a chat. The
image is captured by a headless browser, so it needs Cloudflare's [Browser
Rendering](https://developers.cloudflare.com/browser-rendering/) binding and
only works on a Workers deployment. On the local Node server there is no headless
browser, so the action is shown but disabled.

## Docs

- **[Connecting agents](docs/connecting-agents.md)** — every integration tier in
  detail: CLI, MCP, Pi, plain HTTP, and the Claude Code skill + plugin.
- **[Deploying to Cloudflare](docs/deploying.md)** — run a shared, tokened
  instance.
- **[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)** — architecture and contributor guide.
- **Terminal surface (alpha).** [`sideshow-term/`](sideshow-term/) is an upstream-compatible early
  sibling that renders to a TUI instead of the browser. APIs are unstable.

## Development

```sh
npm run dev          # server with watch + viewer watch build
npm test             # Node unit/API/store tests + viewer unit tests
npm run coverage     # separate all-source Node and viewer-TS coverage reports
npm run test:worker  # real local workerd + Durable Object integration
npm run typecheck    # three tsc programs: node + workers + viewer
npm run lint         # oxlint
npm run format       # oxfmt
```

The server and CLI have no build step — TypeScript runs directly on Node via
native type-stripping, and the npm package ships compiled JS built on prepack.
The viewer (`viewer/src/`, Solid) is Vite-built into a single self-contained
`viewer/dist/index.html` (`npm run build:viewer`). Coverage is reported separately
for Node/Pi code and viewer unit tests rather than combining incompatible runtimes;
the Worker entrypoint is exercised in `workerd` and browser behavior in Playwright,
neither of which is folded into a misleading Node percentage. See
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) for the full architecture and rules.
